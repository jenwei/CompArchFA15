#Documentation
#####Jacob Riedel, Jennifer Wei || Computer Architecture, FA15 Final Project
<The purpose of this markdown is to document our research into Sandy Bridge!>

What did you do?
<Your project abstract: one catchy sentence followed by a paragraph or two. Intended audience should include people that aren't necessarily versed in CA, but are technically competent.>

Why did you do it?
<A paragraph or so about why the project you chose is worthwhile and interesting>

How did you do it?
<Assume an audience has taken CA but don't let the story get bogged down by buzzwords>

How can someone else build on it?
<Work Plan reflection, possible TODOs to extend the depth of the project>
