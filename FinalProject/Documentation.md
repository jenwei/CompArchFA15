#####Jacob Riedel, Jennifer Wei || Computer Architecture, FA15 Final Project
<The purpose of this markdown is to document our research into Sandy Bridge!>

######What did you do?
<Your project abstract: one catchy sentence followed by a paragraph or two. Intended audience should include people that aren't necessarily versed in CA, but are technically competent.>
For our final project, we wrote up a report and made a slide deck to provide a context for which we, and others, could understand Intel's Sandy Bridge generation CPU.

######Why did you do it?
<A paragraph or so about why the project you chose is worthwhile and interesting>
We chose to do a research project on Intel's Sandy Bridge generation CPU for two main reasons. First off, it's the CPU used in our Olin laptops, and secondly, we wanted to apply what we learned in the course to modern-day CPUs and explain some of the intricacies in a way that students from our class would be able to understand as the complexity of modern processors can be overwhelming and seem incomprehensible.

######How did you do it?
<Assume an audience has taken CA but don't let the story get bogged down by buzzwords>
For our research, we first looked into the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture. From there, we looked into the history of CPUs that led to Sandy Bridge and also read up on important terms that we had identified when first trying to understand Sandy Bridge. From there, we selected a couple key terms and delved deeper into them to give an in-depth explanation of these new concepts in a way that Olin Computer Architecture students would be able to comprehend.

######How can someone else build on it?
<Work Plan reflection, possible TODOs to extend the depth of the project>
While doing this project, one main difficulty was with digesting the large quantity of information we found, especially from Hardware Secrets. To get around this, we chose to focus on a couple key terms and go for depth instead of breadth.

In terms of our schedule, we were able to stay on track, though our work plan pivoted slightly. We ended up spending a week and a half researching since we spent the first week researching a breadth of topics related to Sandy Bridge and spent the half week drilling down on specific topics (out-of-order execution and superscalar architecture). Our work plan also pivoted as we decided to work on and a slidedeck first and built off that to write up our report. Overall, we were on track for the most part, with a slight detour due to Jennifer being away for a few days, though we quickly caught up with a couple weekend meetings and were able to have everything finished the night before and ready for a final inspection before turning everything it all in.

As touched upon earlier, modern processors are intricate and complex and have great depth, so there are many different ways that someone can build onto this project. From our research, some terms and concepts that would be interesting include:
- Intel Tick-Tock
- Micro-operation Cache (uop cache)
- Branch Prediction
- Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX)
- Buffers
- Register Renaming
- Intel vs AMD
